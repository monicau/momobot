Maybe, create a Deck object with methods in as ...
 - Initialize
 - Shuffle
 - Deal(n) # n = number of cards
 - ..etc

So each connected user and the bot will have their own deck and methods? ðŸ¤”can avoid the need to use object.freeze?

Card object is good as is. Maybe convert to function with methods instead of class ðŸ“¦

.... and
